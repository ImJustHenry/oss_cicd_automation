Added GUI logging and updated GitHub Action to store crash logs in app.log. Updated requirements.txt to resolve EXE launch issue.

What was changed?

Added logging in GUI.py to capture errors and runtime information into app.log.

Updated GitHub Actions workflow to upload app.log as an artifact after each run.

Updated requirements.txt

Why was it changed?

To improve debugging and traceability of the GUI application in CI/CD pipelines.

To allow maintainers to see crash logs from automated builds without needing to run the app locally.

To fix EXE launch errors caused by package issues.

How was it changed?

Added a logging setup in GUI.py to capture info and error messages.

Updated .github/workflows/... to include python GUI.py > app.log 2>&1 || true and upload the log artifact.

Updated requirements.txt by removing wave that was causing the issue. It was trying to download mysql_python as dependency which caused requirements.txt to fail installing other packages.
